description: Sixth day of walking

---
<!-- Excerpt Start --> 
Today was my sixth day of walking, from Gernika to Lezama. 
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Starting off my feet and legs were very sore so I took it slow today. The inclines were not as steep (approx. 300m) as Tuesday and it was a little bit cooler but still a tough day's walking. Thanks to the 2 lovely ladies from Cork who helped me get through today.

When we arrived at Larrabetzu, the second last spot on today's walk my legs asked me to call it a day, as when coming into Larrabetzu I realised I still had one hour to walk after being on the road 8 hrs. So I grabbed a bus to Lezama!

The first time today I saw signs/writing that reminded me of what country I was walking through.

Distance walked approx. 20km.
