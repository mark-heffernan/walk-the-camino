description: Second day of walking

---
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Today was my second day of walking, from Orio to Getaria. 
<!-- Excerpt End --> 
Weather was lovely but a lot hotter then yesterday with high of 29c. Not as challenging as the first day’s walk with the highest elevation point walked at 90m. 

Walked on my own today and distance walked approx. 11km.
