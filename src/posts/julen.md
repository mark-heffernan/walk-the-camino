description: Lunch at Julen

---
<!-- Excerpt Start --> 
This afternoon I had lunch at nice restaurant called Julen.
<!-- Excerpt End --> 
To escape the hot temperatures of 31c today I found a nice restaurant in Gernika called Julen. 
The restaurant serves a 3 course set menu for &euro;13 which includes a glass of wine or water and a coffee. 

I had the Ensalada de Tomate con Bonito y Cebolla for my first course and the Bacalao al Pil-Pil as my second course. Skipped desert. 
See images below. 

Great value and the food was lovely.
