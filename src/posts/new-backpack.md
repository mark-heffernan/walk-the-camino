The internet is a great tool for researching everything and anything and especially great for anything related to walking/hiking backpacks, hiking boots, waterproofs... you name it!

After an evening of research, I decided to go with a [Deuter Futura 32](https://www.deuter.com/ie-en/shop/backpacks/p225472-hiking-backpack-futura-32) backpack. I used a new website I came across in my research [bergfreunde.eu](https://www.bergfreunde.eu) to purchase the backpack.

From my cycling days, I always used Deuter bags so I was leaning toward this brand from the start.

Btw if you are interested in carry-on backpacks for plane travel check out [Chase Reeves](https://chasereeves.co) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/chasereeves/featured). He's an awesome host and passionate about backpacks and everything connected with travel and travelling light. If I need a new backpack I always use Chase's channel for research. Even if you're not that into backpacks his YouTube channel is worth subscribing to... he'll make you laugh if nothing else.
