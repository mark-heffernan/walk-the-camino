description: Fourth day of walking

---
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Today was my fourth day of walking, from Deba to Markina-Xemein. 
<!-- Excerpt End --> 

Weather was lovely but brutal as the heat never let up today. Hardest day’s walking so far as to get to Markina-Xemein we had to ‘climb’ Mount Arno. Again thankfully the lovely American couple helped me get through this walk along with some lovely Irish folk I met on the trail. 

Distance walked approx. 24km. Elevation approx. 620km.

Well up in the mountains now!

Unfortunately steep uphills mean steep downhills!
