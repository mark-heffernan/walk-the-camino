description: Third day of walking

---
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Today was my third day of walking, from Getaria to Deba. 
<!-- Excerpt End --> 
Weather was lovely and still hot for this time of year. Very challenging as elevation points are getting higher with the highest point today 614m. Thankfully I met a lovely American couple on the trail who helped me get through this walk.  Distance walked approx. 17.5km.

Iâ€™m going to hold off uploading photos of the walks until I have better broadband/connectivity.
