Howdy! I’m {{ name }}, a global traveller who is eager to get back out there and travel the world again.

Plan A is to walk a stage of the Camino de Santiago this year (2022). I hope to use this blog as a way to record each day’s walking by uploading photos and recording any worthwhile experiences I encounter along the way.

If you would like to get in touch go old school and send an email to [travel@heffo.biz](mailto:travel@heffo.biz) to say hello. Or use the [Contact](/contact) form.

I'm using this website to learn some web development technologies like headless [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and static sites deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) and [Forestry](https://forestry.io/).

For the blog comments I'm using GitHub Issues with the [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) app. To post a comment you'll need a login to [GitHub](https://github.com/). If you haven't heard of GitHub this [Medium article - What is GitHub?](https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-github-423f9049ab2d) gives a brief explanation. Logging in helps prevent comment spam. 

Lastly, this website uses the Eleventy Duo theme. If you'd like to use this Eleventy theme for your personal blogs checkout the <a href="https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project's GitHub repo</a>.
