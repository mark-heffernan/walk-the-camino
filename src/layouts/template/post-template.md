Welcome to my new travel blog! I've created this website to record my trip to Spain to walk the Camino de Santiago in 2022.  

At the moment I'm researching the different travel options available e.g. which city to fly to, type of accommodation to stay in and costs.

One of the first items on my to-do list was to purchase a hiking backpack. Check out this [**post**](/posts/new-backpack/index.html) to see which bag I purchased.

In the build-up to the trip, I'll probably only post sporadically but when the trip begins I'll aim to post daily, to keep everybody informed of my progress along my chosen Camino path.
